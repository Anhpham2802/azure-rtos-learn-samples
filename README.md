# Azure RTOS Microsoft Learn Samples

This repo contains sample projects for [Azure RTOS ThreadX](docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/azure-rtos-threadx) courses on Microsoft Learning.

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is the preferred way to building and run these sample if you have your GitHub account enabled for this feature. Otherwise, you can still use it with the [local dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) or set up the toolchain by your own.

## Get started

Follow the [Set up environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/introduction-azure-rtos/2-set-up-environment) unit to get started with the samples.

## Sample project for Visual Studio

You can also find the sample projects that can be built and run with Visual Studio in the [release page](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-rtos-learn-samples/releases/tag/vs). An alternative for using the sample projects. Follow the [get started](#get-started) section above or the readme file in the `.zip` to learn how to use it.
